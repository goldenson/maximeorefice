I'm working for the [biggest remote company](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/) in the world! I'm grateful to be part of this adventure as [our values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) perfectly fit with me.

[Explore](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/) our worldwide team.

## Role

I'm currently a [Backend Engineer](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/backend-engineer/) working with `Ruby`.

I love designing new features and fixing bugs. Being all remote is challenging at first, but once you start it's difficult to come back to a regular office.

## Team

I'm part of the [Verify:Testing](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/ci-cd/verify/testing/) team.

Our goal is to make test easier for everybody. This means we create tools to help companies to develop better and safer software:

- Generate reports giving insights at a glance
- Actionable steps / Advices on how to improve things
- Unit Testing
- Code Coverage
- Accessibility Testing
- Load Testing

## Project

You can follow [our roadmap](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/maturity/#verify), if you are curious to know what we are working on.
