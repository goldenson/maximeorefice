Remote work is rapidly growing these past years. A lot of companies are embracing it by choice or constraint due to the recent health pandemic : `COVID19`.

Some notes about how to work efficiently remotely.

## How to be efficient?

- Work is clearly defined and well scoped
- Communicate effectively, provide daily updates and document everything
- Ask for help if you are stuck
- Find a routine that works for you
- Have daily social breaks during the day
- Dress up like if you were going to work
- Have a dedicate setup at home
- Plan in advance your roadmap
- Travel to meet your team once or more every year
- Provide explicit feedback
