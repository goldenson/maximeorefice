This year I'm planning to build a smart home. Here are some intitial thoughts about the proposal architecture. I will use the open source **home assistant**.

## What

I want to be able to control my home on my smarphone in a safe environment. I don't trust the cloud for this.

I will buy an **Intel NUC 7** which seems the perfect hardware for my needs and my following projects.

## How

Here are the things I will focus first:

1. Shut down all the lights
2. Verify if the door is locked
3. Monitor temperature and humidity
