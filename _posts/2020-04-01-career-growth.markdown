Let's talk about how to move on in your career.

Nobody will take care of it, it's **your responsability** to decide what you want do to.

## Establish a plan

**Objectif Key Result (OKR)** is a good framework that will help you to set up goals and measure them.

Write down somewhere what you want to become and where you see yourself in a short-mid-long term future.

If your manager can't help you to become better, surround yourself with people good at what they do.

## Document your progress

I'm evaluating myself as a company on a **quarter basis**.

Every 3 months I'm doing a retro with myself to check what went well, what did not and what I should work on for the next quarter.

Some folks are using a **brag document** which helps them to summarize everything they accomplished for a given year. This will save you time and your manager's time when performance evaluation season will come.

## Celebrate

After finishing up a project, getting a raise or a promotion. Take the time to enjoy and be grateful for it.

Don't always look for climbing the ladder as soon as possible, give yourself some time.

## Repeat

Go back to your established plan and continue to follow it.

Picturing what you want in life will actually help you to get it.
