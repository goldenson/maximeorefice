Some thoughts about my investment strategy.

## Strategy

The goal here is financial independence to enjoy time with the people I love.

I'm a strong believer in 2 principles:

- Simplicity
- Peace of mind

These 2 criterias are the foundation of my strategy.

Here we are talking about long term investment, something like 20 years+ in the future.

There are currently 2 things I'm interested in and where I'm trying to build knowledge to get better at it.

### 1. Real estate

This is becoming a real hobbie that I will dedicate a special note for it later this year.

### 2. Stock market

I'm currently using [wealthsimple](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9CHAFQ) which satisfies my 2 principles above.

My current porfolio is at **90% stocks and 10% bonds** as I'm in the [wealth acquisition stage](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2014/06/10/stocks-part-xxiii-selecting-your-asset-allocation/) as **JL Collins** calls it.
