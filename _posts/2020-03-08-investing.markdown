Some thoughts about my strategy investing.

## Strategy

The goal here is early retirement to enjoy time with the people I love and I want to spend my time with.

I'm a strong believer in 2 principles:
- Simplicity
- Peacefully

These 2 criterias are the foundation of my strategy.

Here we are talking about long term investment, something like 20 years+ in the future.

There are currently 2 things I'm interested in and where I'm trying to build knowledge to get better at it.

### 1. Real estate

This is becoming a real hobbie that I will dedicate a special note for it later this year.

### 2. Stock market

I'm currently using [wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com) which satisfies my 2 principles above.

My current porfolio is at **80% stocks and 20% bonds**. This might change anytime as I'm still young in my investment career and I can take more risk in my early life.
