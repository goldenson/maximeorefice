Some thoughts about my investment strategy.

## Strategy

The goal here is financial independence to enjoy time with the people I love.

I'm a strong believer in 2 principles:

- Simplicity
- Peace of mind

These 2 criterias are the foundation of my strategy.

Here we are talking about long term investment, something like 20 years+ in the future.

There are currently 2 things I'm interested in and where I'm trying to build knowledge to get better at it.

### 1. Real estate

This is becoming a real hobbie that I will dedicate a special note for it later this year.

### 2. Stock market

I'm currently using [wealthsimple](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9CHAFQ) which satisfies my 2 principles above.

My current porfolio is at **90% stocks and 10% bonds** as I'm in the [wealth acquisition stage](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2014/06/10/stocks-part-xxiii-selecting-your-asset-allocation/) as **JL Collins** calls it.

#### RRSP

> REER in Qu√©bec

Every year I'm maxing out this account (18% of my last year income). And we are doing the same for my wife's accounts.

I invest all of this account with stocks and bonds as decribed above.

> If you are married and you earn more money than your wife consider opening a [Spousal RRSP](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/learn/spousal-rrsp)

#### TFSA

> CELI in Qu√©bec

I'm using this account for stock picking with [Wealthsimple Trade](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/product/trade/).

This account is a huge advantage in Canada, as you don't pay taxes on capital gains. This means if your money double in 10 years you will be tax exempt on it.

#### Dividend Strategy

I'm currently building a new investment portfolio for my wife buying exclusively dividends.

I've opened a `Spousal RRSP` on [questrade](https://www.questrade.com/home) and I'm using [getpassiv](https://getpassiv.com/) which connects to my broker and automate some boring stuff such as maintaining target allocation and portfolio rebalancing.

I will add more notes about this strategy in a couple of months, stay tuned.

### 3. Cryptocurrency

I believe in a world lead by technology as software is eating the world.

I only own Bitcoin. If you are looking to buy some in Canada with the lowest commission fees, try [BullBitcoin](https://bullbitcoin.com/).
