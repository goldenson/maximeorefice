Some thoughts about my investment strategy.

## Strategy

The goal here is financial independence to enjoy time with the people I love.

I'm a strong believer in 2 principles:

- Simplicity
- Peace of mind

These 2 criterias are the foundation of my strategy.

Here we are talking about long term investment, something like 20 years+ in the future.

There are currently 2 things I'm interested in and where I'm trying to build knowledge to get better at it.

### 1. Real estate

This is becoming a real hobbie that I will dedicate a special note for it later this year.

### 2. Stock market

I'm currently using [wealthsimple](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9CHAFQ) which satisfies my 2 principles above.

My current porfolio is at **90% stocks and 10% bonds** as I'm in the [wealth acquisition stage](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2014/06/10/stocks-part-xxiii-selecting-your-asset-allocation/) as **JL Collins** calls it.

#### RRSP

Every year I'm maxing out this account (18% of my last year income). And we are doing the same for my wife's accounts.

I invest all of this account with stocks and bonds as decribed above.

#### TFSA

Im using this account for stock picking with [Wealthsimple Trade](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/product/trade/).

This account is a huge advantage in Canada, as you don't pay taxes with capital gains. This means if your money double in 10 years you will be tax exempt on it.

### 3. Bitcoin

I believe in crypotocurrency and I own only Bitcoin.

You can buy bitcoin without any commissions in Canada on [BullBitcoin](https://bullbitcoin.com/).
