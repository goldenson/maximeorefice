Let's talk about the most powerful financial tool ever.

## Before

The young **Max** did not want to believe in this market which in fact drives our society. Our economy is built on this system which collapsed many times and is still here today. Interesting isn't ?

I got lucky to join a startup offering stocks options that performed incredibly well in the market which begins to hit my curiosity.

## After

Most people see the stock market as a complex world which they feel too dumb to understand.

Let's take a look at how this works and how you can leverage this tool to increase your wealth.

> Wealth: an abundance of valuable possessions or money.

### What does it mean to buy a stock?

This means you own a part of a company.

### What stocks can you buy?

Many options exist today. I call them **financial products**. See them as something you would buy at a shop except it could bring you money over time. Here a small list of the things you can buy on the stock market.

#### [Stocks](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/what-is-a-stock/)

Stocks are securities that represent an ownership share in a company. For companies, issuing stock is a way to raise money to grow and invest in their business. For investors, stocks are a way to grow their money and outpace inflation over time.

#### [ETFs](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/learn/what-is-etf)

An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a collection of stocks or bonds that may be purchased for one price.

#### [Bonds](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/investment/what-is-a-bond)

A bond represents a loan from the buyer (you) to the issuer of the bond.

#### [Dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp)

A divident is a distribution of a company's profit to shareholders.

### Where can you buy financial assets?

You would need a **brokerage** account to start investing in the stock market.

> Broker: Company that charges a fee or commission for executing buy and sell orders submitted by an investor.
