Let's talk about the most powerful financial tool ever.

## Before

The young **Max** did not want to believe in this market which in fact drives our society. Our economy is built on this system which collapsed many times and is still here today. Interesting isn't ?

I got lucky to join a startup offering stocks options that performed incredibly well in the market which begin to hit my curiosity about this market.

I'm sharing what I wish somebody would have told me at school to understand how this crazy world works.

## After

Welcome to the most powerful industry leading our world today.

It's fascinating what people think about the stock market. Most of people see it as a complex world which they feel too dumb to understand. In fact, I'm sure it was designed this way so the rich can become richer. Actually, we don't give a shit.

Let's understand how this works and why can't you use it to increase your wealth.

> Wealth: an abundance of valuable possessions or money.

### What does it mean to buy a stock?

This means you own a part of a company.

### What stocks can you buy?

Many options exist today, they are called **financial products**. See them as something you would buy at a shop except it could bring you money over time.

#### ETF

#### Bonds

#### Stocks
