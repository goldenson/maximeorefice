I'm working for the [biggest remote company](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/) in the world! I'm grateful to be part of this adventure as [our values](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) perfectly fit with me.

[Explore](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/) our worldwide team.

## Role

I'm currently a [Senior Backend Engineer](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/backend-engineer/) working with `Ruby`.

I love designing new features and fixing bugs. Being all remote is challenging at first, but once you start it's difficult to come back to a regular office.

## Team

I'm part of the [Verify:Pipeline Security](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/pipeline-security/) team.

Our goal is to make the CI experience easier for everybody. This means we create tools to help companies developping better and safer software:

- Maintain [Build Artifacts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/job_artifacts.html)
- Manage [CI Variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/)
- Secure pipeline with [CI Job Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html)
- Building [Gitlab Secrets Manager](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10108)

## Project

You can follow [our roadmap](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/maturity/#verify), if you are curious to know what we are working on.
