# How to fill your taxes in Canada?

I've been surprised how many canadians were outsourcing their taxes by a professional. If you don't have a complex financial situation you will be surprised how easy it is.

Please **don't paid for it** and **learn how taxes work** so you will be in control of your financial life.

Do it by yourself and use an assistant software like [SimpleTax](https://help.simpletax.ca/questions/how-to-use).

## Work

Your employer will provide you a tax document called a [T4](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4.html). If you have multiple employers the same year you will then have multiple T4s.

> In QuÃ©bec we have an additional tax document called an [R1](https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/online-services/forms-and-publications/current-details/rl-1-t/).

### T4

Using **SimpleTax**, this is a straightforward task. Just follow what SimpleTax asks for and report the corresponding boxes from your T4 to SimpleTax.

### R1

If you live in QuÃ©bec, you will get asked to report the data about your R1. Take your R1 provided by your employer and repeat the task as you did with your T4.

## Stock market

If you invest in the market you will need to let the government knows how much you invested/made during the fiscal year.

### T5008

This form is usually generated by your broker at the end of the fiscal year.

- **Adjust Cost Base (ACB):** This value is could be generated on your T5008. Otherwise, make sure you register somewhere how much you bought/sold, when and at which exchange rate (USD/CAD).

The Canadian government wants this value in CAD, so make sure you convert using the [annual exchange rate](https://help.simpletax.ca/questions/annual-exchange-rates) before submitting it.

### T5

This form is provided by your bank during the tax season for your RRSP and your savings accounts.

## Real estate

If you have a renting property, you can claim money to the government if you did major renovations. I will add more information about this next year.
