# Growth 🌱

I'm a geek who loves to solve problems and automate things to make my life easier with technology.

After spending half a decade coding, I'm looking at new perspectives to keep learning new things everyday:
- Marketing
- Sales
- Human Psychology
- Financial Freedom

# Family 👰😸

I'm a family man above all. I'm married to my lovely wife, we've been dating for almost a decade. We decided to adopt a cat together.

# Food 🍕

I'm a huge cooking fan. I cook daily, go to my local market and chat with the suppliers to get all the best fresh products I need.

My favorite meal is the [neapolitan pizza](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&sxsrf=ACYBGNRZ6lYmizxoRqjq2_FvqdkJyctEDg%3A1573512106638&source=hp&biw=1440&bih=730&ei=quPJXbarJI6d5wKE94_wBw&q=neapolitan+pizza) as my dad used to make for 25 years.
