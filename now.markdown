I'm currently interested about few things in life these days:

- Technology

I love coding, automating things and making people's life easier.
After few years at coding, I recently start learning marketing with the great [Stan LeLoup](https://marketingmania.fr/) and it's been a fascinating ride so far.

I'm also planning to learn some basic design skills at before the end of 2019.

- Food

I love cooking, it's one of my hobbie and it's the best when you share it with people.
My favorite meal is a great napolitean pizza as my dad used to make for 25 years.

- Wife

I'm dedicating a lot of energy and time to my wife which I'm so grateful to have found early in my life.
We started experimenting with arts recently and built our first mosaic !
