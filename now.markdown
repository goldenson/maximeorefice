I'm currently interested in few things in life these days:

# Technology

I love coding, automating things and making people's life easier.
After few years at coding, I recently started to learn marketing concepts with the amazing [Stan LeLoup](https://marketingmania.fr/) and it's been a fascinating ride so far.

I'm also planning to learn some basic design skills before the end of 2019.

# Food

I'm a huge fan of cooking, it's one of my favorite hobbie and it's the best when you share it with people.
My favorite meal is a great [neapolitan pizza](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&sxsrf=ACYBGNRZ6lYmizxoRqjq2_FvqdkJyctEDg%3A1573512106638&source=hp&biw=1440&bih=730&ei=quPJXbarJI6d5wKE94_wBw&q=neapolitan+pizza) as my dad used to make for 25 years.

# Wife

I'm dedicating a lot of energy and time to my wife which I'm so grateful to have found early in my life.
We started experimenting with arts recently and built our first mosaic !
